# Good Coffee

### A short story by Josh Beam

His psyche inherited the city’s pervasive anonymity. He was a part of the city’s blood, moving as a cell through its network of veins, arriving at his destination unnoticed. He was integral yet irrelevant; pertinent yet pointless; inconsequential, immaterial, a foreign body, yet depended upon for the city’s fundamental existence. Their relationship was a simple tautology.

What was it like to observe this phenomenon from the outside? He sat alone at a bar, a stillness amidst a blur of conversation, whiskey, and mixed drinks. The barista moved mechanically, yet socially. He asked for a Jack, neat. Classics came from the speakers overhead. A silent baseball game played on a television in the background, an excuse for those alone, like him, to be at a bar.

To his left, he caught pieces of a conversation between a German man and the man’s date, a stout lady. Pretty, brown hair, but with a tinge of drunken annoyance in her tinny voice, forcing conversation out of the either restrained, apathetic, or apprehensive German man eating salted peanuts and drinking beer next to her. She complained to the German man about her day, and apologized for not making a good conversational companion. She asked him a personal question, and he was taken aback. She scolded him for this.

To his right, he caught pieces of a conversation between a Swedish man and the man’s date, a womanly figure whose appearance he couldn’t quite make out in the dusky darkness. The man had pulled-back, blonde hair, slurredly going on about his previous relationship, and how he was now in a very happy place in life.

He caught pieces of conversations at which, on the surface, he scoffed at, but perhaps somewhere internally, these types of conversation (those which made up a certain part of life), were those which he yearned to have with a potential lover.

### The first day

> “You’ve got a lot of nerve, half-naked in my bed.”
*— Noah Gundersen*

The next morning, he sat at a coffee shop, a bitter macchiato snarkily leering at him. The air was bustling from the movement of the ant-like humanoids around him, moving quickly from one place to another, gathering up food and trotting back to their assigned seats.

He observed a young woman, perhaps a tourist, perhaps a new resident. She was artistry, a beautiful creation. Broken, elegant, whimsical, silent, mischievous. Her mannerisms gave away her secrets. He knew her before he spoke to her. Her eyes told a story of a woman deserted by her lover.

She was now the stillness amidst a blur of conversation, coffee, and egg sandwiches. A silhouette. A vignette standing against this conveyor belt of a city. He sat close enough that he could make shallow conversation.

“That’s good coffee, huh?”

She did a double-take take, “yes, and I like to mix it with hot chocolate, but people make fun of me for this.” Her broken English aroused his curiosity.

She appeared to be wearing last night’s clothes, but not due to promiscuity or recklessness. Merely a sign of dedication to some sort of art. She was a painter, perhaps, or a dancer. Ah yes, a painter. He observed a small collection of photographs next to a saucer on her table. They were images of her paintings. Blurred, naked figurines. Lost, anguished, exhausted. Reminiscent of her soul, perhaps.

A breeze licked her short auburn hair, revealing a portion of her neck, her dark cream-colored skin, a consistent shade across her body. Consistent across her smooth legs, the small of her back, her hands holding her warm porcelain coffee cup. As the clouds floated across the sky, sun beams occasionally illuminated her face, rays flickering from her green eyes, revealing a certain depth unknown to him before this particular moment.

She spoke to him for quite a time, and though he had difficulty remembering her exact words, he had no trouble acknowledging the most paradoxical, immediate nostalgia surfacing within him. It was the warmest, calmest hurricane of essential feeling. Most of the time he wasn’t even listening to what she was saying. He just enjoyed the sound of her voice.

“Have you eaten yet? I’ve been meaning to check out this place in Chinatown.” She nodded her head with a silly grin.

> “Come on, keep me where the light is.”
*— John Mayer*

He waited for her for too long. But it was worth it. She wore a porcelain, waffled skirt. A dark satin shirt with the two top buttons undone. That dark cream-colored skin contrasting against her clothing. A product of both nature and man’s creation. That beautiful short auburn hair was pulled back with two clips. She wore dark makeup specifically for him.

They wandered alone through the people of the city, through Chinatown, through the smells and the pollution and the noise and the stale air, and it was beautiful. They moved opposite the flow of this school of fish. They decided they would stop at whichever restaurant smelled the best, as this was, in fact, the only way worth choosing a restaurant (this was something about which she was humorously adamant). As they walked, their hands periodically brushed against one another. She spoke to him, again, for some time. Most of the time he wasn’t even listening to what she was saying. He just enjoyed the sound of her voice.

They sat close at a tiny table in the corner of an even tinier restaurant. At one point (and much to the dismay of the waitress), she accidentally poured chocolate powder on her sandwich, thinking it was pepper. Perhaps it was one of her foreign tendencies to blame. One could use immigrant status as an excuse for these types of social missteps any day of the year, as far as he was concerned.

This city was a recently opened novel, full of new stories and opportunities, a sort of exhilaration that can only be garnered from embarking on a certain type of risky adventure. As her eyes had told him the story of woman recently deserted by her lover, so his eyes might have told a similar story of a man absent of love for the longest time. Tired and painfully awaiting a fanciful abstraction, an imaginary moment in time that he was sure would occur. A woman would appear from nowhere, they would embrace one another and be one against the world. Was she this fanciful abstraction, this solidary notion? It appeared thus.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/joshwashere/20917763795/in/dateposted-public/" title="Cigarette"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/648/20917763795_c15d2d7cf0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Cigarette"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

They sat close in the grass of a park nearby, exchanging glances. Young sweethearts lounged about, flirting in low voices under the sunshine. They smoked cigarettes. She lit hers with a lighter, and leaned in close to his lips to light his with the tip of hers. And too soon, it was time for her to go.

### The second day

The second day, they ran to the beach. She would flirtingly bump into him during their run, provoking a sort of childish play between them. When they arrived at the beach, the sun had already set. They sat on concrete steps overlooking the water. He admired the grace with which she stretched in front of him to ease the pain of her sore muscles. She sat down close to him once again, and they shared a cigarette. She was sitting closer than the previous day. She offered warmth against the cold air. And oh, what a rhythm she was. A silent music. They became the anonymity. He kissed her cheek.

### The third day

> “Women move like hurricanes,

> Trying to find someone to blame.”
*— 22-20s*

“I don’t know what I want,” she said.

She talked to him, at last, for a while, and he never said a word. Most of the time he wasn't even listening to what she was saying. He didn't want to hear her voice anymore.

And thus, again, it was him, the anonymity. The stillness amongst this crowded desert, a cell within the vein of the city. Moving but going nowhere. A desolate whirlwind, picking things up, and putting them back down, but never in their original place. A piece of a machine, essential to the whole but worthless on its own. The lifeforce of the city was feckless; irresponsible and undignified. It consumed everything and gave nothing back. What is worth the pain brought upon one by love gained and subsequently lost? It is omnipresent and unforgiving.

The next day, he saw another woman coming in for a drink. He thought again of commenting on the quality of the coffee, but thought it better that he not.

> “Oh, you're kissing me again

> Oh, and I can't see it

> You've got a lot of nerve

> Throw me out the way you did

> You've got a lot of nerve

> Half-naked in my bed.”
